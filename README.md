# CPRF-JavaGilderTermSim
This java application was developed to help the Cal Poly Rose Float Electronics Team simulate the GilderTerm software. This software is used to control and tune the GilderFluke electronic control system. This was also just a nice way for me to get additional practice for my object-oriented programming class.

Please note that this simulator was heavily inspired by the original simulator created by Lakers2O13. I recommend checking it out here: https://github.com/Lakers2O13/Rose-Float-Animation-Simulation.
